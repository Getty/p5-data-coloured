=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use DDC;

  my $coloured = coloured($data);
  my $coloured = c($data);
  poloured($data); # print coloured
  pc($data);       # same

  use Data::Coloured; # no auto export of pc and c

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is made for visualizing in coloured and printable form random bytes
of a data stream or any other source. It was specifically made for debugging
TCP and UART connections, to also see the control characters.

This module does the following with the data for return or print:

=over

=item Control characters

The ASCII control characters are described on L<Wikipedia|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#ASCII_control_code_chart>.
Those get replaced with their name listed in "Abbreviation" on the Wikipedia
page, surrounded by square brackets (exception is here B<HT> which is shown as
B<TAB>). The ANSI colour is B<bright_red>

=item Printable characters

The prinatable characters (from space to ~) are just taken as is, and put in
the colour B<bright_yellow>.

=item Binary characters / extended ASCII

All non printable characters, so those above 127, are converted into their hex
value and surrounded by angle brackets.
